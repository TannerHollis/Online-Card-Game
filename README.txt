This project has a long-term goal of creating a card-based game that plays like a regular card game, except for when you are attacking or defending during a turn.

Match Progression:
1. Connect with player.
2. Randomize start turn.
3. Player Turn.
4. Other Player Turn.
5. If either player has zero lives on all cards, game over. The other Player wins.

Turn Progression:
1. Player draws two cards before turn starts. These card may be applied to character cards to buff/heal characters.
2. Select card to attack with.
3. Select attack/buff to use.
*Scene changes view to side-viewing "platformer" where a mini, "Super Smash"-like experience decides the winner of the attack.
4. Players fight until one has been defeated.
5. Bonuses are provided for the winner, lives are deducted from the cards for the loser.
6. Turn end.
